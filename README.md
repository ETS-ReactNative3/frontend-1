  React Native application to run the Med Manager 3.0 app.

## Development

**Note**: I suggest using `yarn` as it is generally faster than using `npm`. If you need to install `yarn` you can do so [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable). This installation assumes you already have Node.js installed onto your machine.

### Enviornment

To setup your enviroment for React Native development you must first follow [this](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) in-depth guide. The guide includes instructions for both the Windows and macOS enviornments. For **macOS**, make sure your OS is up-to-date and you have XCode installed before referring to the guide.

### Installation Steps

#### Step 0: Change Directories to the Project Folder

If you are not already inside the projects directory, you can execute this command to cd into it.

```
cd frontend
```

#### Step 1: Install the Dependencies

Run the following command to install the projects dependencies:

```
yarn
```

or

```
npm install
```

#### Step 2: Start the Development Server

Run the following command:

```
yarn start
```

or

```
npm run start
```

#### Step 3: Start the Simulator

To launch the iOS version of the app run the following command:

```
yarn ios
```

or

```
npm run ios
```

To launch the android version of the app run the following command:

```
yarn android
```

or

```
npm run anroid
```

To get flow working with VS Code, follow [this](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode#setup) setup process.
